A set of informative documents to assist in understanding the Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM) and its associated API.

The Documents directory consist of:

- A set of examples. There is a separate readme file within the examples directory.
- A different view of the USDM Model. This diagram is maintained in a application called [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
- A set of "slides" that provides a walkthrough of the USDM. This PDF is an export from a Miro board
