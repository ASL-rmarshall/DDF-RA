# Examples

Each study example is held in a separate directory and includes the source spreadsheet, the protocol and the resulting USDM API JSON file. Three study examples are currently included:

- The old CDISC Pilot Study (LZZT)
- An Eli Lilly Diabetes Study (NCT03421379)
- An Alexion Wilson's Disease Study (NCT04573309)

In addition, a temporary example file has been included with release 3.10.1. This file shows the handling of medical devices. The data contained within the example is test data and not taken from an existing protocol. This file will be replaced with a realistic example as we pass through public review for USDM v4.
