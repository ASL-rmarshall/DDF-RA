# Examples

Each study example is held in a separate directory and includes the source spreadsheet, the protocol and the resulting USDM API JSON file. Three study examples are currently included:

- The old CDISC Pilot Study (LZZT)
- An Eli Lilly Diabetes Study (NCT03421379)
- An Alexion Wilson's Disease Study (NCT04573309)

In addition, two temporary examples have been included with release 3.10.2. The data contained within the example is test data and not taken from an existing protocol. These files will be replaced with a realistic example as we pass through public review for USDM v4.

- Devices: This file shows the handling of medical devices. 
- Observational: This file shows a simple example of an observational study and the attributes for the StudyDesign class
